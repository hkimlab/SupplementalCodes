Supplementary Code 1 - Indel Searcher:

Implements Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm to determine the frequencies ofinsertions and deletions (indels) in target sites from deep sequencing data.

Supplementary Code 2 - Model Comparison:

Compares Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for linear, exponential, Gompertz, and logistic models to best describe our data.

Supplementary Code 3 - t0 and Half-life (HL) Calculations:

A general HL and t0 was determined using the best-fitting model that produces the minimal residual sum of squares.
